This release addresses critical Git security vulnerabilities. Immediate upgrade to GitKraken v6.4.0 is recommended. Please [review this article](https://blog.axosoft.com/critical-security-patch-git-gitkraken/) for more information.

<h3> New ✨</h3>
_A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...was a Git GUI without activity logs._ 

<ul>
 <li>Introducing <a href="/working-with-repositories/activity-logs/">Activity Logs</a>! Users can now view all Git actions made to repositories and all application actions made in GitKraken Client through activity logs. Access this feature through the new <i class="fas fa-list"></i> icon in the footer toolbar. 
  <ul>
   <li>To access the activity log for a repository, navigate to the repo’s tab and click the <i class="fas fa-list"></i> icon. You will then see any Git actions made in the repo listed in chronological order on the tab titled <kbd>Repository</kbd>.</li>
   <li>To access the activity log of local application changes made in GitKraken Client, click the <i class="fas fa-list"></i> icon. You will then see all application changes listed in chronological order on the tab titled <kbd>Application</kbd>.</li>
   <li>The progress of Git hooks can also be tracked through activity logs. All Git hooks within the repository's log contain a clickable link where you can click to view the hook’s output in a separate tab.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<h3>Improved 🙌</h3>
_We polished our lightsabers and dusted off our droids to make these improvements your new reality._

- We have added additional context to the error message that displays when opening a pull request with a remote ref that doesn’t exist.

<h3> Bug Fixes 🐛</h3>

- When opening GitKraken Client, if the most recent tab is not a Glo Boards tab, and the user switches to or opens a new Glo tab, the Glo Board is now correctly in focus. 
- Commit search now closes upon opening the [Fuzzy Finder](/start-here/fuzzy-finder/). 
- Editing a file to a previous state no longer creates an empty WIP node. 
- Users cannot use keyboard shortcut <kbd>Cmd</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> to search commits when the graph is blocked by a prompt for input (as search results would not be visible behind the prompt’s display box). 
- The <button class='button button--primary button--ui button--nolink'><span style='color:#141422;'>Get Support</span></button> button on a new tab now works as expected. 
- Bitbucket remote origins now correctly display their name instead of displaying `undefinied`. 
- GitLab users can view and create pull requests from repositories in subgroups. 
- Users will be appropriately directed to <kbd>Account Management</kbd> in the application after clicking <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Upgrade Now</button> during the free trial period.
