<h3>Features</h3>

* *Raise your chalice!* GitKraken Client now supports [GPG commit signing](/git-workflows-and-extensions/commit-signing-with-gpg/). This helps verify the identity of users making commits within GitKraken Client, and prevents other users from fraudulently using your alias to make commits. *After all, there’s only one true King of the North.*  
* GitKraken Client now has [Interactive Rebase](/working-with-repositories/interactive-rebase/) functionality—with a process so smooth and efficient you’ll feel like Brienne of Tarth with a sword. When you drag-and-drop a branch to rebase, you will now see an option for interactive rebase. After opening the interactive rebase view, you can choose from a menu of actions for each commit:
    * On the left, pick, reword, squash, or drop commits. 
    * Use ⬆️ and ⬇️ keys to navigate commits. 
    * Double-click a commit to reword. 
    * Drag-and-drop to move commits up and down.
    * Use keyboard shortcuts to perform all of these actions! 
* You can also right-click on a commit in the graph to access the interactive rebase option for child commits: 
    * Squash without HEAD
    * Move commit
    * Edit commit message
    * Drop commit

<h3>Improvements</h3>
* Fetching on a repository with multiple remotes is now faster. It will feel like flying on a dragon!
* *Braavos!* An option to clone a repository has been added to GitKraken Client welcome screen. 
* The commit panel will now display the committer in addition to the author if the two are different. *No more taking credit for the accomplishments of others, Littlefinger...*


<h3>Bug Fixes 🐛</h3>
* Our team resolved a memory leak that would occur with the Fetch operation. *Varys and his birds will have to find their secrets elsewhere.*
* GitKraken Client will no longer throw a “Fetching pull requests failed” error when fetching from an Azure DevOps repository without using the integration. *Daenerys doesn’t put up with liars.*
* For MacOS users, selecting the `X` icon in the toolbar will no longer keep the client hidden until a force quit.
